# Project: Python for Financial Analysis & Investment Strategy Simulation

This project is a personal learning journey into the world of finance and data analysis using Python, as detailed in `project_overview.md`. The initial focus is on simulating Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategies, with plans to expand into broader financial concepts and advanced data tooling.

(Optional: If using nbdev extensively, you can mention it here: "This project utilizes `nbdev` to structure library code developed from Jupyter Notebooks.")

## Overview

Refer to `project_overview.md` for a comprehensive description of project goals, learning objectives, technologies, and project structure.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository (if you've hosted it on Git):**
    ```bash
    # git clone <your-repo-url>
    # cd <your-project-directory-name>
    ```
    If you started from a template and removed its `.git` history, you'll initialize a new repository:
    ```bash
    # git init
    # git add .
    # git commit -m "Initial commit for Financial Analysis project"
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a conda environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create --name gambling-investment
    conda activate fin_analysis_env
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install `pip` in your conda environment (if not already perfectly configured) and then install packages from `requirements.txt`.
    ```bash
    make install
    ```
    Ensure `requirements.txt` includes `nbdev` if you are using the `make build` command.

4.  **Set up API keys:**
    Create a `settings.ini` file in the root directory (refer to `project_overview.md` or my previous suggestion for its structure). Add your API keys for services like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance (if `yfinance` requires them for certain features).
    **Important:** Add `settings.ini` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent committing sensitive information.

## Project Workflow

* **Notebook Development (`nbs/` directory):**
    * Primary development and exploration happen in Jupyter Notebooks located in the `nbs/` directory. Start with `dca_analysis.ipynb`.
    * To launch Jupyter:
        ```bash
        make notebook  # or make lab
        ```

* **Building the Library (if using `nbdev`):**
    * If you're using `nbdev` to create a Python library from your notebooks:
        ```bash
        make build
        ```
    * This will export Python modules to a directory (usually named after your project, e.g., `finanalysis`) and clean the notebooks.

* **Application Modules (`app/` directory):**
    * Core logic that's more stable or intended for direct execution (like dashboards or standalone scripts) can be placed in the `app/` directory. This can include modules generated by `nbdev` or manually created scripts.

* **Documentation (`docs/` directory):**
    * Refer to `project_overview.md` and any specific guides in the `docs/` directory.
